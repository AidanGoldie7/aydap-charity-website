            <h1>AYDAP Scotland : Empowering Education in Liberia, West Africa </h1>
            <div class="about-col">

                <p style="">AYDAP Scotland is a dedicated fundraising charity, proudly registered in Scotland, with a profound mission to make a meaningful difference in the lives of students in Liberia, West Africa. Our journey began in January 2020, when we took the reins from an earlier charity established in 2004, carrying forward a legacy of unwavering support for education.
                
                Led by a passionate and experienced team of three Trustees, we are committed to realizing our vision of providing quality education to underprivileged youth in Liberia. Our distinguished Trustees bring a wealth of knowledge and expertise to our cause: Donald S Goldie, a retired accountant, has been the steady hand as our treasurer since the charity's inception in 2004; Benny Andersen, a retired Transport manager, brings invaluable insights into efficient operations, and Professor Peter Langhorne, a retired surgeon, provides his extensive experience in healthcare and education.
                
                At AYDAP Scotland, we believe that education is the cornerstone of hope and opportunity. Our primary goal is to raise essential funds to support the educational needs of the school in Liberia, ensuring that students have access to quality learning resources and a safe, nurturing environment to thrive. We are dedicated to empowering the next generation in Liberia, helping them unlock their full potential and build brighter futures.
                
                Join us on this meaningful journey as we continue to make a lasting impact through education. Together, we can create a world where every child has the chance to learn, grow, and achieve their dreams.</p>
